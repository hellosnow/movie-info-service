## Key Findings

### Application Overview
The Movie Info Service is a Spring Boot application that provides a REST API for searching and retrieving movie information. It integrates with two external movie databases:
- TheMovieDB (https://api.themoviedb.org)
- OMDb API (http://www.omdbapi.com)

The application uses:
- Reactive programming model with Spring WebFlux
- Redis for caching movie data
- Factory pattern for API client selection
- Both synchronous and reactive streaming endpoints

### Modernization Recommendations

Based on the assessment findings, the following modernization activities are recommended:

1. **Java Version Upgrade**
   - Current: Java 1.8
   - Target: Java 11/17/21 LTS
   - Benefit: Access to modern Java features, improved performance, long-term support

2. **Spring Boot Framework Upgrade**
   - Current: Spring Boot 2.3.2
   - Target: Spring Boot 3.x
   - Benefit: Latest features, security patches, cloud-native improvements

3. **Deprecated API Updates**
   - Address 5 deprecated API issues
   - Update to current recommended APIs
   - Improve maintainability and future compatibility

4. **Cloud-Native Caching**
   - Migrate from Redis to Azure Cache for Redis
   - Implement managed service patterns
   - Improve scalability and reliability

5. **Remote Communication Patterns**
   - Review 7 remote communication issues
   - Implement retry and circuit breaker patterns
   - Add proper error handling and resilience

6. **Local Resource Access**
   - Review 2 local resource access patterns
   - Adapt for containerized environments
   - Ensure Azure compatibility

## Next Steps

1. **Review Assessment Report**: 
   - Open `report.json` to see detailed issue descriptions
   - Prioritize issues based on severity and effort

2. **Review Architecture Diagram**:
   - Open `assessment-diagram.md` to visualize the application structure
   - Understand component relationships and data flow

3. **Plan Modernization**:
   - Create a modernization plan based on assessment findings
   - Use the `create-modernization-plan` skill to generate an execution plan
   - Prioritize high-impact, low-effort improvements

4. **Execute Upgrades**:
   - Start with Java and Spring Boot version upgrades
   - Address deprecated APIs
   - Implement cloud-native patterns

5. **Validate and Test**:
   - Run comprehensive tests after each change
   - Validate Azure compatibility
   - Performance test with Azure services
